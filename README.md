# My Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository contains a collection of my **Machine Learning** projects, including code, models, and evaluation metrics. Feel free to explore my work, and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.

## üöÄ Projects

### 1. Sales Prediction Model
- **Description**: A machine learning model that predicts sales values based on historical sales data using **Random Forest**.
- **Technologies**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Random Forest
- **Model**: [Download the trained model](#) (You can link to a `.pkl` or `.joblib` file here)
- **Evaluation**: 
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 1,370,558.93
  - The model predicts the sales value based on the features provided.
  
- **Steps to Use**:
  1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio.git
     ```
  2. Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
  3. Run the training script:
     ```bash
     python train_model.py
     ```

### 2. Customer Classification
- **Description**: A classification model to predict customer behavior (whether they will purchase a product or not).
- **Technologies**: Python, scikit-learn, Random Forest Classifier
- **Model**: [Download the trained model](#) (Link the model file here)
- **Evaluation**: 
  - **Accuracy**: 85%
  - The model classifies customers into different categories.
